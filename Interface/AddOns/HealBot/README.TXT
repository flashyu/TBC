Please read if...

You have a version of Healbot older than 1st Jan 2008
	or
You have a 2008 version before 2.4.0.1
-----------------------------------------------------



Due to Player Class name changes on non EN clients, changes have been made to HealBot from 2.4.0.1

If you have a version prior to WoW 2.4, installing HealBot 2.4.0.1+ will reset your Spells, Cure and Buff tabs to defaults.

Also recommend searching your WFT directory for all files with HealBot in the name, delete these files
Note: Deleting Healbot files in directories under WTF will reset all settings to defaults

---------------

The up side is these changes has reduced HealBot memory usage by ~150KB.
There will be a small performance gain.
